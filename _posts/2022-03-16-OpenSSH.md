# OpenSSH Client on Windows 10

## Why use OpenSSH instead putty or WinSCP?
OpenSSH is a modern tool which works out of the box with most of the servers. Once installed on your PC, creating and managing the keys are just a couple is done easily without opening windows or clicking around. Furthermore OpenSSH provides you with the functionality of both tools combined, i.e. the private-public key pair via `ssh-keygen` and the secure copy function via `scp`.


_"OpenSSH is the de facto standard implementation of the SSH protocol. If PuTTY and OpenSSH differ, PuTTY is the one that's incompatible._

_If you generate a key with OpenSSH using `ssh-keygen` with the default options, it will work with virtually every server out there. A server that doesn't accept such a key would be antique, using a different implementation of SSH, or configured in a weird restrictive way._

_PuTTY uses a different key file format. It comes with tools to convert between its own .ppk format and the format of OpenSSH."_ [1]

## Installation Process

### Step 0
The OpenSSH Client and Server is available on Windows 10 with a build higher than 1809. To check the version, open the Windows commandline `cmd.exe`

### Step 2
The above command will open the __Optional features__ window

- Search the list of __Installed features__ for `OpenSSH` to see if it is installed already

- If not installed, click on __Add a feature__ inside the box
- here you type __openssh__ in the Search box and press <kbd>ENTER</kbd>
- Select __OpenSSH Client__ in the results
- Click __Install__ button to get the `OpenSSH` installed on your machine

After the installation is done you can verify it by typing the following in the terminal.

```cmd
where ssh
```
you should see the following output
```cmd
C:\Windows\System32\OpenSSH\ssh.exe
```

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ now the `OpenSSH` is installed on your machine! In the next subsection we will generate ssh keys.

## Generating Public-Private Key Pair
In order to generate a public-private key pair we use the
following command

```sh
ssh-keygen
```
which will give the following output

```
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (C:\Users\HighHarmonics\.ssh\id_rsa)
```
Leave the default path as it is. Your username would be a different one, off course. It may also ask you for a password for the key pair. You can go ahead without it.

### Accessing the Public Key
To get your Public key, you can use the following command

```
cat C:\Users\HighHarmonics\.ssh\id_rsa.pub
```
which will produce something like the following

```
ssh-rsa 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highharmonics@MacBuntu
```

You can copy this output and paste to trusted keys on the server side.
